### Python Project Setup

Most of my python projects have a common baseline. This page explains how this looks like, so that we can reuse it. There are two main options to go about this. 

- Use a template approach and develop localy.
- Develop inside a dev container

There is a nice template called Cookiecutter which creates a dev environment locally based on an opiniated approach on python development.
