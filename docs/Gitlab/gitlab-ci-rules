Title: Gitlab CI Rules
---

### Gitlab CI Rules

Before we can start using rules, we must understand variables. They come from a lot of different places, like:
- CI/CD Configuration
- Default Gitlab variables
- Genrated from previous jobs
- Project/Group configuration

[Predefiend variables](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/ci/variables/predefined_variables.html) are not meant to be overwritten, but can be used in Rules. Some of them are very common:
- `CI_API_V4_URL` - API base url of Gitlab instance
- `CI_COMMIT_BRANCH` - Branch name


### Pipeline Triggers

Pipelines can be triggered by any of the following events:
- new commit
- new branch
- new tag
- manual
- api call
- scheduled
